At a particular company, departments are composed of named teams and each team has a yearly budget. Teams have both employees and equipment, each of which have a yearly cost. A team is over budget if the total yearly cost of all employees and equipment is greater than the team's budget. It should be possible to get a list of all teams within a department that are over budget.
