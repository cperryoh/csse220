Reflection Questions:

1.A In your implementation could you replace each Question class with just a Java String (yes or no)? 
No

1.B Explain why or why not? (2-3 sentences)
This can not be done for 2 reasons.

Without a class to surround the string, the question can not be linked to an id.

Also, without a class the question will not be updated throughout the program.


2.A. What data type did you use to represent the 1-to-many relationship between QuizMain and Question? (provide the type declaration)
I used a hash map to correlate an integer id to a question object. 



2.B. What is another data type could you have used? (provide the type declaration) 
One array list.

2.C. Would that have made your implementation easier or harder to implement? Explain why? (2-3 sentences)
Harder, I would have to manually look for and object with the id that im looking for instead of asking the has map for the object.
